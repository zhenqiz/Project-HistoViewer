Now we can load raw csv

recently working on:
analyzing the csv and redrawing pins on the picture after load
export pins coordinates as csv

some questions:
drawing a box is great, but how to keep the info, is OSD providing any API for that?
Using SVG to draw box maybe
-------------------------------------
Finished:
Now we can add pin on the canvas

More to do:
Load and export coordinates as CSV
Draw Box
Deeplearning auto-label
