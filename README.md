Now we can export annotations as csv files and import it back. Not for pin points yet, but I'll do this later

Text box is also in progress

Next-to-do:

More function and maybe can start to take look at applying ML now?..:D

-------------01/01/2017-------------

Integrate an already-developed plug-in OSD-Annotation and it
enable us to draw annotation as u like! Wonderful plug-in

Next-to-do:

Save and load annotation and pins as csv file.

-------------11/17/2016-------------
Now we can load raw csv

recently working on:
analyzing the csv and redrawing pins on the picture after load
export pins coordinates as csv

some questions:
drawing a box is great, but how to keep the info, is OSD providing any API for that?
Using SVG to draw box maybe
-------------------------------------
Finished:
Now we can add pin on the canvas

More to do:
Load and export coordinates as CSV
Draw Box
Deeplearning auto-label
